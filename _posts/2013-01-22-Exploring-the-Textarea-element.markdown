If you have ever found yourself implementing some kind of editor in javascript using the textarea element, you might find [this little tool](/resources/TextareaExplorer.html) useful.  I put it together as I was building a WSIWYG editor for this blog. Sure there's plenty of pre built solutions out there  which have more features than I can even think of (or use), but the whole point is to learn something.

If you happen to be using jQuery, I would strongly recommend taking a look at the [fieldselection plugin](https://github.com/localhost/jquery-fieldselection). It basically abstracts the browser specific quirks away from you, so you can focus on manipulating the contents of the textarea.

As for the tool I built, it was useful to see how textareas behave in different browsers and inspect the contents of the textarea easily.
